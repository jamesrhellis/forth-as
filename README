Forth-as : forth assembler for ARM assembly

This is a simple forth assembler for ARM assembly, assembling to
a useful RISC subset of the fixed-width AArch32 encoding.

Included is a demo forth for an emulated raspberry pi 2 b, 
using the '-serial stdio' for IO.

The demo can be run using:
gforth forth-demo.f
qemu-system-arm -m 256 -M raspi2 -serial stdio -kernel out.bin
